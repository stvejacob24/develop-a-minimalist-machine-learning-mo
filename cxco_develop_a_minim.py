cxco_develop_a_minim.py: A Minimalist Machine Learning Model Monitor

This project aims to create a simple monitoring system for machine learning models.
The system will track the performance of a model over time and alert the user
if the model's performance drops below a certain threshold.

Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

Features:
- Load and monitor a machine learning model
- Track model performance over time
- Alert the user if the model's performance drops below a threshold
- Visualize model performance using matplotlib

Classes:
- ModelMonitor: The main class that monitors the model's performance

Functions:
- load_model: Loads a machine learning model from a file
- evaluate_model: Evaluates the model's performance on a dataset
- alert_user: Alerts the user if the model's performance drops below a threshold
- visualize_performance: Visualizes the model's performance over time
